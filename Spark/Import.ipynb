problem in deep sub-micron technology, a shift from deterministic static timing analysis to statistical static timing analysis for high-performance circuit designs could reduce the excessive conservatism that is built into current timing design methods. We address the timing yield problem for sequential circuits and propose a statistical approach to handle it. We consider the spatial and path reconvergence correlations between path delays, set-up time and hold time constraints, and clock skew due to process variations. We propose a method to get the timing yield based on the delay distributions of register-to-register paths in the circuit On average, the timing yield results obtained by our approach have average errors of less than 1.0% in comparison with Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results show that shortest path variations and clock skew due to process variations have considerable impact on circuit timing, which could bias the timing yield results. In addition, the correlation between longest and shortest path delays is not significant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |Unknown      |53a72e2020f7420be8c80142|[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]|[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 6, 19, 20, 21]             |[1, 2]         |[53f43b03dabfaedce555bf2a, 53f45ee9dabfaee43ecda842, 53f42e8cdabfaee1c0a4274e]                          |[53e9a8a9b7602d97031f6bb9, 599c7b6b601a182cd27360da, 53e9b443b7602d9703f3e52b, 53e9a6a6b7602d9702fdc57e, 599c7b6a601a182cd2735703, 53e9aad9b7602d970345afea, 5582821f0cf2bf7bae57ac18, 5e8911859fced0a24bb9a2ba, 53e9b002b7602d9703a5c932]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n","|53e99784b7602d9701f3f411|Using XML to Integrate Existing Software Systems into the Web                                  |2002|28        |167       |172      |en  |      |     |0-7695-1727-7|10.1109/CMPSAC.2002.1044548     |                                                                                                            |The eXtensible Markup Language 驴 XML 驴 is not only a language for communication between humans and the web, it is also a language for communication between programs.

On one hand, the more resources that are provisioned to a multitier web application, the easier it is to meet service level objectives (SLO). On the other hand, the virtual machine which hosts the multi-tier web application needs to be consolidated as much as possible in order to maintain high resource utilization. This paper presents an adaptive resource controller which consists of a feedback utilization controller and an auto-regressive and moving average model (ARMA)-based model estimator. It can meet application-level quality of service (QoS) goals while achieving high resource utilization. To evaluate the proposed controllers, simulations are performed on a testbed simulating a virtual data center using Xen virtual machines. Experimental results indicate that the controllers can improve CPU utilization and make the best tradeoff between resource utilization and performance for multi-tier web applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |Unknown      |572de199d39c4f49934b3d5c|[63, 64, 65]                                                                                                                        |[34, 35, 36, 37, 6, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44]             |[6, 7, 8]      |[53f46a22dabfaee0d9c3d5e5]                                                                              |[53e9a073b7602d9702957efa, 53e9ad87b7602d970377bfb5, 53e9be51b7602d9704b11381, 53e9be04b7602d9704abb31d, 53e9992bb7602d9702169236, 53e998cdb7602d97021044db, 53e9afa6b7602d97039f6054, 53e99822b7602d9702044e60]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n","|53e99784b7602d9701f3f95d|FCLOS                                                                                          |2009|0         |192       |220      |en  |68    |2    |             |10.1016/j.datak.2008.09.003     |                                                                                                            |Mobile online analytical processing (mOLAP) encompasses all necessary technologies for information systems that enable OLAP data access to users carrying a mobile device. This paper presents FCLOS, a complete client–server architecture explicitly designed for mOLAP. FCLOS founds on intelligent scheduling and compressed transmissions in order to become a query efficient, self-adaptive and scalable mOLAP information system. Scheduling exploits derivability between data cubes in order to group related queries and eventually reduce the necessary transmissions (broadcasts). Compression is achieved by the m-Dwarf, a novel, compressed data cube physical structure, which has no loss of semantic information and is explicitly designed for mobile applications. The superiority of FCLOS against state of the art systems is shown both experimentally and analytically.

revolution that has also begun to impact on governance and development at a domestic level in areas such as e-governance, e-commerce and e-health. The state, private and civil sectors have invested in numerous initiatives throughout the length and breadth of India aimed at extending the benefits of the information revolution to rural and remote areas. These range from Reliance Infocom’s roll out of low-cost mobile cellular phones, to numerous civil society based initiatives aimed at establishing affordable access to information and knowledge. The state continues to invest in ICTs for development – from its support for Village Public Telephones (VPTs) to its enabling the computerisation of land records such as the Bhoomi project in Karnataka. The state’s recognition of the role played by private and civil society sectors in development marks a major and distinct change in attitude from one characterised by ‘tolerance’ at best for these sectors and belief in the self-sufficiency of a ‘dirigiste’ economy, to pragmatic accomodations with these sectors. This change is to some extent a reflection of post-SAP policies adopted by the state, best illustrated by its steady withdrawal of support from its welfare agenda.

Somalia issued a joint statement raising concerns over the renewed intensifi cation of the confl ict and military action in South Central Somalia. In their statement, the organizations requested the international community and all parties to the confl ict to protect civilians, ensure humanitarian access and strengthen all eff orts to fi nd a peaceful solution to the confl ict.  The humanitarian community faces a serious shortfall in funding for Somalia. In the fi rst quarter of 2010, only US$121 million, or 14 percent of the $689 million budget of the Humanitarian Appeal has been raised. The non-food portion received eight percent while the Water and Sanitation, Education and Logistics sectors received no funding. Key emergency aid sectors are struggling to respond to needs and maintain regular programming.  On 11 March, the United Nations Sanctions Committee's Monitoring Group on Somalia released a report stating that up to one half of food aid to Somalia was diverted from the needy. The report has negatively aff ected the perception of how humanitarian assistance is delivered in Somalia at a time when humanitarian needs are critical with 3.2 million Somalis in need.

The major reason is the changing age distribution of the population with more elderly people in need of support. At the same time, health care systems are often very labor and staff intensive. In this paper, we focus on a staff planning problem arising in Sweden where people receive home care from the local authorities. The objective is to develop visiting schedules for care providers that incorporate some restrictions and soft objectives. Each visit has a particular task to be performed, for example: cleaning, washing, personal hygiene and/or nursing activities. Each staff member has skills and each client should, if possible, be visited by the same contact person. The operational situation is continuously changing and planning is done each day. We describe the development of a decision support system Laps Care to aid the planners. The system consists of a number of components including information data bases, maps, optimization routines, and report possibilities. We formulate the problem using a set partitioning model and, for a solution method, we make use of a repeated matching algorithm. The system is currently in operation at a number of home care organizations. We report on the practical impact of the system in the health care organization which was involved in the development. The savings are considerably in terms of saved planning time and in the quality of the routes, as well as the measured quality for the clients. Numerical experiments of the system are presented.|North-Holland|548259f6582fc50b5e138119|[75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81]

limitations due to the use of fixed bias during the learning process. To overcome the limitations of such base-learning approaches, a research trend explores the potentialities of meta-learning, which is oriented to the development of mechanisms based on a dynamical search of bias. This may lead to an improvement of the base-learner performance on specific learning tasks, by profiting of the accumulated past experience. In this paper, we present a meta-learning framework called Mindful (Meta INDuctive neuro-FUzzy Learning) which is founded on the integration of connectionist paradigms and fuzzy knowledge management. Due to its peculiar organisation, Mindful can be exploited on different levels of application, being able to accumulate learning experience in cross-task contexts. This specific knowledge is gathered during the meta-learning activity and it is exploited to suggest parametrisation for future base-learning tasks. The evaluation of the Mindful system is detailed through an ensemble of experimental sessions involving both synthetic domains and real-world data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |Elsevier     |53a72ngtzvwygvydkdy5rfho|[82, 83, 84]                                                                                                                        |[139, 140, 141, 142, 3, 144, 145, 6, 147, 148, 149, 150]|[25, 26]       |[5448a3b5dabfae87b7e55ecb, 54343235dabfaebba584dfd2, 5405bdb6dabfae8faa5faf1f]                          |[53e9b0c2b7602d9703b38520, 53e9a6b5b7602d9702feb55b, 53e9bc36b7602d97048a9356, 5736961f6e3b12023e530656, 558a340584ae84d265bc3481, 53e9a487b7602d9702da622b, 53e99e8cb7602d970275565e, 53e9bdadb7602d9704a5b5dc, 53e9bad0b7602d97046ffade, 53e9a13fb7602d9702a2db40, 53e998a9b7602d97020e0601, 557defc3d19faf961d16566a, 53e9983db7602d970206a300, 53e99b8db7602d9702432d99, 53e99ca1b7602d9702552bfa, 53e9a479b7602d9702d98e3e, 53e9bc27b7602d970489157c, 53e9b16db7602d9703bf656a, 53e9b8e8b7602d97044c81c0, 53e9a5b7b7602d9702ee3b1e, 53e9b4ceb7602d9703fed817, 53e99bc6b7602d970246fbfb, 53e9b1c9b7602d9703c5a468, 558a589b84ae84d265bd0e74, 53e9a455b7602d9702d73c31, 557e8ffed19faf961d16aa9e, 53e99ea0b7602d970276a919, 53e9b206b7602d9703c991cd, 53e9a65fb7602d9702f8e4da, 53e99a7fb7602d97022f5abb, 53e9a9cbb7602d97033280fd, 53e99cedb7602d97025a4021, 53e99991b7602d97021d2b83]                                                                                                                                  |\n","|53e9978db7602d9701f4d1aa|MESHMdl                                                                                        |2007|0         |467       |487      |en  |3     |4    |             |10.1016/j.pmcj.2007.04.003      |                                                                                                            |Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are gaining importance as a promising technology for flexible, proximity-based, mobile communication. However, the inherent dynamics of MANETs imposes strong limitations on the design of distributed applications. They need to be able to adapt to changing conditions quickly and organize themselves in terms of component placement and communication habits. In this paper, we present MESHMdl, a middleware that provides a high level of awareness and decoupling for application components to make them more flexible and adaptable. We focus on the Event Space as the central communication medium of MESHMdl. The Event Space offers a simple, unified communication interface for inter-agent communication as well as for communication with the middleware and resource access. Furthermore, it serves as a means for flexibly extending a MESHMdl daemon. We investigate the performance of the Event Space on different mobile devices and show that it is superior to comparable systems.
